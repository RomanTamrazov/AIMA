Adam has been fascinated by AI and chatbots since playing with [Racter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racter) in the 80’s. But the “winters” were long and frequent. The stars aligned in 2015 when he became VPE at Ravel Law. Ravel was building AI-powered tools for the legal industry and was working with Harvard Law School on what is now known as the Caselaw Access Project. After an acquisition by LexisNexis in 2017, he moved his family to Raleigh (in 2019) to take the role of CTO of Global Platforms. In 2022 he joined IBM to work on domain-specific applications of generative AI. Adam holds an MS and BS in CS from UCLA and Stanford, respectively.

Swedish IT organizations are juggling hybrid cloud, sprawling identities, and relentless compliance pressure. The result is risk, friction, and slow delivery.\\n\\n**Sign up here --> https://luma.com/yeg8o3op?tk=tqXE3w**\\n\\n​We’ll show a different path. Exploring what good information security means, what principles to know and use and how to translate that into concrete technologies and actions.

Yet, the default response is often to collect excessive logs and alerts, leading to noise, fatigue, and slow response times. This talk presents a clearer approach: centralizing security-relevant data, across identity, endpoints, cloud, and applications, and turning it into actionable insight that can be automated for faster and cheaper response. You’ll leave with a practical understanding of SIEM and SOAR: what they are, why they matter, and how to use them to build more resilient, scalable security operations.\\n*Alex Löfstrand @ Irori*\\n\\n## ​**Talk 2: Secure infrastructure**\\n\\n​Focusing on the layers beneath SIEM & SOAR, we cover how we securely provision, access, and manage the systems where detection and response occur. Using tools like Terraform, Vault, and Boundary, we’ll explore how to automate secure deployments, manage secrets, and enforce least-privilege access across cloud environments.\\nFredrik Warfvinge @ HashiCorp\",\"startDate\":\"2025-11-26T16:00:00.000Z\",\"endDate\":\"\",\"eventStatus\":\"https://schema.org/EventScheduled\",\"image\":\"/images/fallbacks/redesign/group-cover-5-square.webp\",\"eventAttendanceMode\":\"https://schema.org/OfflineEventAttendanceMode\",\"location\":{\"@type\":\"Place\",\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressLocality\":\"\",\"addressRegion\":\"\",\"addressCountry\":\"\"}},\"organizer\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Stockholm Open Source Data Infrastructure Meetup\",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/stockholm-open-source-data-infrastructure-meetup/\"},\"performer\":\"Stockholm Open Source Data Infrastructure Meetup\"},{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Event\",\"name\":\"Måste all AI verkligen köras i molnet?\",\"url\":\"https://www.meetup.com/west-forest-tech-meetup-hw-sw-mek/events/311853218/\",\"description\":\"**Måste all AI verkligen köras i molnet?**\\nInte längre.
